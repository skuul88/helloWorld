Hi I'm Skuu88 formerly Skuul77. My name is due to a misspelling of the first email address I ever created and It's just kinda stuck with me.
I'm a poorly paid parts man at a small marine shop, and I'm trying to teach myself how to code. It's been a struggle, but I'm going to stick with it because I really want to make this a career.
I love Video Games and the idea that one day I may be able to make one of my own.
